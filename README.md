Proxy Program


To start program, run VehicleTest.java. This file initializes the database with entries for each vehicle submitted.
There are two proxy access controls built in, Access and NoAccess. I currently have two vehicles to test access with.


I could not get the RMI to work on my machine. I spent a while looking into it, but not too sure as to what was the problem.
I found a localized way to represent the proxy from the book.
